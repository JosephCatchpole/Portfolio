    "### What happens when you call a function \n",
    " the function-call stack supports the function call/return mechanism. Eventually, each function must return program control to the point at which it was called. For\n",
    "each function call, the interpreter pushes an entry called a stack frame (or an activation\n",
    "record) onto the stack. This entry contains the return location that the called function\n",
    "needs so it can return control to its caller. When the function finishes executing, the interpreter pops the function’s stack frame, and control transfers to the return location that was\n",
    "popped.\n",
    "The top stack frame always contains the information the currently executing function\n",
    "needs to return control to its caller. If before a function returns it makes a call to another\n",
    "function, the interpreter pushes a stack frame for that function call onto the stack. Thus,\n",
    "the return address required by the newly called function to return to its caller is now on\n",
    "top of the stack.\n",
    "#### Local Variables and Stack Frames\n",
    "Most functions have one or more parameters and possibly local variables that need to:\n",
    "• exist while the function is executing,\n",
    "• remain active if the function makes calls to other functions, and\n",
    "• “go away” when the function returns to its caller.\n",
    "A called function’s stack frame is the perfect place to reserve memory for the function’s\n",
    "local variables. That stack frame is pushed when the function is called and exists while the\n",
    "function is executing. When that function returns, it no longer needs its local variables, so\n",
    "its stack frame is popped from the stack, and its local variables no longer exist.\n",
    "#### Stack Overflow\n",
    "Of course, the amount of memory in a computer is finite, so only a certain amount of\n",
    "memory can be used to store stack frames on the function-call stack. If the function-call\n",
    "stack runs out of memory as a result of too many function calls, a fatal error known as stack\n",
    "overflow occurs.5 Stack overflows actually are rare unless you have a logic error that keeps\n",
    "calling functions that never return. \n"
